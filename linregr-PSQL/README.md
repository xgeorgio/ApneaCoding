<b>Linear regression and stats in PostgreSQL</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a very simple set of three SQL queries demonstrating how in-server data processing can enable some basic data analytics. It may seem mute when this can be easily done with Python or other code in fewer lines. But pushing the data processing part within the RDBMS server via properly crafted SQL can enable ultra-low-power IoT devices with absolutely minimal memory and processing resources (for example a micro-controller) to do stuff that are typically unfeasible otherwise.
