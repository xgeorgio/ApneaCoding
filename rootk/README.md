<b>Roots and powers of any order in C</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This program is a simple demonstration of how roots and powers of any integer order can be estimated iteratively without power series or logarithms. The exponent can also be negative, in which case the reciprocal (1/x) is calculated. The power(k) is implemented via normal iteration, while the root(k) is implemented by a trivial Newton-Raphson design. These two routines can be used as-is in programming languages without a rich math library or when no-FP Assembly is the only tool available (e.g. very old microcontrollers).
