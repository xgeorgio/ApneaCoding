<b>Quantum numbers calculation in C++</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a very short example of how C++ implements basic syntax and console I/O, including format manipulation similar to printf() in C. The quantum numbers are the four basic items that define trajectories and properties for electrons in every atom of elements in the Periodic Table.
