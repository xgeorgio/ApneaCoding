<b>Linear system solver in Fortran</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>In linear Algebra, solving linear systems is one of the fundamental things to learn and also the simplest algorithms to teach in introductory programming courses. The solvers range from non-iterative methods for small systems to specialized algorithms for sparse or ill-conditioned matrices.</p> 
<p>In this session, the non-iterative method of determinants is implemented in "vanilla" Fortran 77, showing the gradual complexity of the code as the system's size progresses from 2x2 to 3x3. Moreover, this non-iterative form illustrates how such small systems can be highly optimized by the compilers, even back in the '70s-'80s, like the DOS-era session demonstrated here.</p>
