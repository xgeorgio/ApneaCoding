<b>Atmospheric data calculations in Python</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a straight-forward implemention of the two-layer International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model, commonly used in portable devices, watches and small-aircraft instrumentation. It is a simplified version of the multi-layer and exo-atmospheric models employed in civil aviation, military aircraft and space engineering.</p> 
<p>This small code is bundled around a function that incorporates all constants, parameters and pre-calculations for the three exponential models, namel for atmospheric pressure, density and temperature, available in both SI and Imperial units. This Python code is small and simple enough to be included even in micro-controller applications (e.g. Arduino) for high-precision calibration of other external sensors used in altitude significantly above sea level.
