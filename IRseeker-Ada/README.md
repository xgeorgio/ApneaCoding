<b>IR seeker tracking algorithm for spin-scan sensor in Ada</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This small demo illustrates how the IR sensor signal of a guidance system based on spin-scan "rising sun" pattern can be processed in order to detect targets and extract bearing and strength (distance) information. The "rising sun" spin-scan generates basic phase and amplitude modulation that can be analyzed providing multi-target detection within the available Field-Of-View (FOV). However, it is notoriously sensitive to strong IR sources within FOV, like the sun, flares (counter-measures), etc.

The Ada programming language is a creation of CII Honeywell Bull company in 1977-1983, under contract to the USA Department of Defense (DoD), with the goal of being the one-fits-all replacement of over 450 other languages used by DoD at that time in various embedded and real-time systems. "Ada" is the credit to Ada Lovelance (1815â€“1852) or "lady Ada", often referred to as the first computer programmer.

The most popular Ada compilers for retro PCs came out Ada came out at the Windows 95/98 era, requiring some DPMI host or extender like DJGPP to run, making it possibly unstable for emulated DOS environments. For this example, OneCompiler.com platform is used instead of a stand-alone native DOS compiler.
