<b>Pi estimation in Logo</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>In this simple example, the graphical interface of Logo is used to demonstrate the standard Monte-Carlo statistical estimation of the value of Pi (3.1415...). Instead of simply trying random draws in the 'background', each (x,y) sample is drawed in a quarter-circle as the estimation progresses. A minimal template to introduce kids to Mathematics and Logo itself.</p>
