<b>Logic gates in PIO assembly</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a very simple example of how low-level assembly for very limited hardware like the PIO modules in Raspberry Pi Pico can be used to implement logic gates and more complex instructions. In practice, this is how micro-code is designed for CPU instruction sets.</p>
