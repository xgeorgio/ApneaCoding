<b>Pi value estimation in CLIPS</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a simple demonstration for illustrating the basic syntax and capabilities of CLIPS. It is the acronym of "C Language Integrated Production System", a framework developed in the mid-80s by NASA-Johnson Space Center for developing Expert Systems (ES). The original name of the project was "NASA's AI Language" (NAIL). Although declarative by nature, it is a multi-paradigm language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, including control flow and loops. Its use was phased out in NASA by mid-90s when the organization lost interest in using ES, but in general it remained the most popular framework for developing ES until about 2005.</p>
