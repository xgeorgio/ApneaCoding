<b>Mempeek: Display DOS memory contents in C</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This program is a simple demonstration of how memory management worked in the MS-DOS era, when 16-bit CPU architectures were based on 'segment:offset' addressing. In order to see the contents of a specific location in memory, segment and offset must be defined. 

The program is very similar to 'DEBUG.EXE' which was included in the original distribution of MS-DOS 3.x for viewing the memory contents when another program is loaded or after its termination (TSR), as well as viewing specific reserved addresses in BIOS and other device drivers like extended/expanded memory managers (XMS/EMS) like 'HIMEM.SYS'.
