<b>Elements of AI: Propositional Calculus</b>

<p>In Artificial Intelligence, first-order Logic is the most basic form of knowledge representation and the fundamental theory for almost all rule-based inference mechanisms. It is the direct translation if Logic and Boole Algerbra into programming primitives that can be formulated into such a programming language, like Prolog and LISP.</p>
<p>In this first lecture, Propositional Calculus is presented with the fundamental entities, operations and inference, including reasoning and resolution. This is the base for the next lecture, which is on Predicate Calculus, a step closer to "real" logic programming with variables and graph search algorithms.</p>
