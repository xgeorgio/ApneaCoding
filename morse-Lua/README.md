<b>Morse encoder/decoder demo in Lua</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a very simple code snippet demonstrating the basic syntax of Lua, using Morse ITU encoding/decoding as a test case. An association table and in-place string manipulation functions are used for short and compact code. Lua often considered as "fast alternative" of Python, with less packages available but more well-suited for small-footprint and IoT applications.
