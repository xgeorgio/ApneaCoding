Title:<br/>
<b>Minimum Distance Classifier in Logo</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>Logo is typically an entry-level educational language for introduction to programming concepts like functions, control flow and loops. But it also supports basic file I/O and easy graphics/plots, i.e., all the core functionality needed for demonstrating more advanced algorithms as in Machine Learning.</p>
<p>In this simple demonstration, the retro version of IBM Logo is used to present the essence of Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC) for a typical 2-class separation task. The training dataset is read from a file and the training process is plotted while it progresses.</p>
