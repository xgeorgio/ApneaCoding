<b>Hamming(7,4) error correction in R</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>In Coding Theory, Hamming(7,4) is the simplest variant of the linear error-correcting code from this family of methods. It implements a 7-bit message block with 4-bit payload, capable of identifying and correcting all single-bit errors and detecting (only) double-bit errors. It is not as robust as modern coding methods (e.g. turbo codes) and performs poorly in burst errors, but it is still in use in situations where the bit errors are only sparse or when the hardware resources are extremely limited (e.g. micro-controllers).</p>
<p>This session demonstrates a "tutorial" version in R, in order to clearly see every matrix, operation and intermediate result. It can be easily converted to any other matrix-oriented code (Matlab, Python/numpy, Julia, etc) and of course to any bit-level implementation for real-world deployment (e.g. C/C++, Assembly,etc).</p>
