Title:<br/>
<b>File split/merge in C</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This program is a simple demonstration for splitting and merging (binary) files with only few lines of code. These have been traditionally useful command-line tools for downloading or sending very large archive files since the early days of Unix/Linux. For demonstration purposes, instead of standard I/O stream functions in C (stdio.h), the corresponding OS system calls are used (open, read, write, close).
