Title:<br/>
<b>Fibonacci: Configuration file parser in C, C++ and Java.</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>The Fibonacci series is a very important sequence in Mathematics, as it depicts the evolution of many natural processes, like the population growth in closed environments. The definition is very simple via a recursive function, but its implementation has at least four different variations, depending on the design.

This program demonstrates these four implementation options:
<ol>
<li>recursive (direct)</li>
<li>iterative (non-recursive)</li>
<li>dynamic programming (cached)</li>
<li>analytical (math. solution)</li>
</ol>
