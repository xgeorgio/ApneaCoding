# Apnea Coding
<p>Welcome to the repository of the "ApneaCoding" channel:</p>
<p>Here you will find coding sessions, programming tutorials and lessons, in-depth view of how we structure source code based on problem specifications and how we perform basic code testing for simple use cases. Furthermore, downscaled variations of real-world applications are investigated and implemented using the tools of that era, simulating the software that actually worked / works with them.</p>
<p>Extensive experimental sessions are available for selected topics in Machine Learning and Data Analytics, demonstrating tools and platforms for data management, cleansing, visualization, pipeline setup, model design, training and evaluation, up to the code prototyping phase.</p>
<p>For more information, check the <a href="https://apneacoding.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Content page</a> in this site and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@apneacoding" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> with all the video material.</p>
