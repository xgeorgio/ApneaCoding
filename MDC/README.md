<b>Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC) in Ada</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This program is a short example in Ada illustrating basic syntax, subroutines, type constructions and console I/O. Specifically, a basic pattern classifier from Machine Learning, namely a Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC), is constructed by just two core functions/procedures and about 120 lines of code. This type of classifier can successfully address linearly separable problems, here in the 2-D planar domain (X,Y).

The Ada programming language is a creation of a CII Honeywell Bull company in 1977-1983, under contract to the USA Department of Defense (DoD), with the goal of being the one-fits-all replacement of over 450 other languages used by DoD at that time in various embedded and real-time systems. "Ada" is the credit to Ada Lovelance (1815â€“1852) or "lady Ada", often referred to as the first computer programmer.

The most popular Ada compilers for retro PCs came out Ada came out at the Windows 95/98 era, requiring some DPMI host or extender like DJGPP to run, making it possibly unstable for emulated DOS environments. For this example, OneCompiler.com platform can be used instead of a stand-alone native DOS compiler.
