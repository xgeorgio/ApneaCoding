<b>Signed integer multiplication with the Russian algorithm in Kotlin</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a very short code snippet demonstrating the basic syntax of Kotlin, which is very closely related to Java but with many more functional programming features. Instead of the standard method with long multiplications and additions, the Russian algorithm uses only additions and bit shifts with complexity log2(Nbits), where Nbits is the bit length of the smallest multiplication term. This is the way multiplication is implemented in may hardware designs.
