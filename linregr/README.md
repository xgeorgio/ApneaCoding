<b>Linear regression LSE fit in Matlab/Octave</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>Linear regression LSE fit in retro Matlab 3.5 (MS-DOS) back in the early '90s. The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate elementary data processing and statistics via non-iterative coding paradigms, i.e., based on matrix operations only. Matlab was one of the first programming platforms to adopt such a matrix-based 'algebraic' data manipulation procedure as the core part of the language, like R and Python (numpy, pandas) do today. 

Although its functionality and toolboxes some three decades ago were nowhere near today's status and richness, it still was one of the most powerful platform for linear Algebra, signal processing and visual data exploration. The most common and almost 100% compatible open-source alternative is Octave, which is also in use today in many Universities around the world.
