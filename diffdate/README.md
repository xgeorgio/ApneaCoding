<b>Date/time difference calculations in PHP</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is just a small snippet of PHP code illustrating the use of generic variables and console (server-side) scripting. Although PHP is almost entirely focused on web application development, basic syntax and features make it a general-purpose programming choice like other more popular alternatives, e.g. Python, Perl, Tcl, Bash, etc.
