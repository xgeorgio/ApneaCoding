<b>Quadratic equation solver in GW-Basic</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>Quadratic equation (ax^2+bx+c=0) solver in retro GW-Basic no-talking, in emulated 80286 / MS-DOS machine in DOSbox. This tutorial is a taste of how home programming looked like in the early '80s, while also showing how difficult it was to correctly pre-plan all goto conditional jumps beforehand when line numbering and editing was the only way to actually edit the source code.
