<b>Floating-point epsilon estimation in GW-Basic</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>Floating-point epsilon estimation in retro GW-Basic no-talking, in emulated 80286 / MS-DOS machine in DOSbox. This very short code demonstrates how easy it is to get the actual FP accuracy, i.e., the significant decimal digits in FP arithmetic operations. The result in GW-Basic is seven FP digits, which is consistent with 2-byte float types used in other programming languages of that era like Fortran and C.
