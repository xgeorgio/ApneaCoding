<b>Factorial with Stirling's formula in Rust</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This is a very simple code snippet demonstrating the basic syntax of Rust, which is a strong rival against C/C++ for equally fast but much safer language in terms of memory management, type checking and concurrency. Stirling's approximation for factorial n! is implemented as a demo for proper mixed-type arithmetic operations.
