<b>wwc: Text file statistics in C</b>

Description:<br/>
<p>This program is a simple demonstration for illustrating how basic text file statistics can be retrieved with only 50 lines of C code. It is more or less a replacement of the standard 'wc' program available in all Unix/Linux distributions for returning the lines, words and characters of any text file given as input.
